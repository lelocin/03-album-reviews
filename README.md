# Week 3 - Album Reviews 
This is my API and web scraping project that uses Spotify API to retrieve all album names given an artist entered by the user, then finds each album's rating and details on Pitchfork, an online music publication.

- Examples: Travis Scott, The 1975 & Taylor Swift

## Chosen API and Website
The chosen API is Spotify and chosen website is Pitchfork. I am very interested in the music industry so I use these two platforms regularly.
- Collected data from Spotify include Artist Names and Album Names. 
- Collected data from Pitchfork includes album rating.

## Dataset Value 
This dataset is not yet available because it will result in controversies if Spotify, a neutral music streaming platform, subjectively rates music albums. This will also damange Spotify's relationship with music labels that provide copyrights to Spotify. However, this will be an interesting data point for music labels to collect feedback for their artists and potentially develop new strategies to better cater to the market.  

## Usage
- Make sure Git and Python are installed
- Clone the repository
- Install required libraries: pip install -r requirements.txt
- Run the code and view output results
